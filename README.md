# Hey, I'm Zhich~

## About Me
‚ú® I am a self taught developer that mainly codes in Swift and makes MacOS apps. I am trying to learn AI right now by learning the math required for it (Calculus, Linear Algebra, etc.)

## Here are some things I've been working on!

  üìñ I am a student currently studying in school, aiming to score good grades.

  üß† Equipped with knowledge of basic syntaxes and formatting for [Python][2] and enough knowledge for building real iOS apps with [Swift][3] and [SwiftUI][7].

  ‚ú® Wishes to keep learning Python to build AI apps, currently working on my math skills. I presently know basic math like trigonometry and calculus. 
  
  üéâ Managed to scribble enough code to squeeze out a couple of desktop apps using [C#][11] and [XAML][12].

  üë®‚Äçüíª Aiming to work in [AI-related][8] industries.
